    description: `<p>The Basilica of Saint Francis stands as one of Christianity's most sacred sites and a turning point in Western art history. Pope Gregory IX laid the foundation stone in 1228, just two years after Francis of Assisi's death, and construction of the two-stacked churches was completed by 1253. The site, once a hill used for executions, became UNESCO's designation as a "masterpiece of human creative genius" for good reason. Within these walls, <a href="/apps/masterpieces/artist/giotto-di-bondone"><strong>Giotto di Bondone</strong></a> sparked an artistic revolution with his frescoes depicting the life of St. Francis.</p>

<p><a href="/apps/masterpieces/artist/giotto-di-bondone"><strong>Giotto</strong></a>'s 28-scene cycle in the Upper Church, painted between 1296 and 1304, broke decisively from the flat <strong>Byzantine tradition</strong> that had dominated medieval painting. His figures show weight, emotion, and spatial depth that artists would build upon for centuries. <a href="/apps/masterpieces/artist/cimabue"><strong>Cimabue</strong></a>'s earlier crucifixion scene in the transept shows the older style that Giotto transformed. The 1997 earthquakes damaged several vault sections, but restoration has preserved most of the cycle. Visitors enter through the Lower Church to reach St. Francis's tomb, then climb to the Upper Church where light floods the famous frescoes. The combination of pilgrimage destination and art historical landmark draws both the devout and the curious.</p>`,
    faqs: [
      { question: "When was the Basilica of Saint Francis built?", answer: "Pope Gregory IX laid the foundation stone on July 17, 1228, the day after St. Francis was canonized. The <strong>Lower Church</strong> was completed by 1230, and the Upper Church followed in 1253. The entire complex took 25 years to build." },
      { question: "What famous artworks are in the Basilica?", answer: "<a href=\"/apps/masterpieces/artist/giotto-di-bondone\"><strong>Giotto</strong></a>'s 28-scene fresco cycle depicting St. Francis's life is the main attraction. <a href=\"/apps/masterpieces/artist/cimabue\"><strong>Cimabue</strong></a> painted the earlier crucifixion in the transept, showing the Byzantine style Giotto transformed." },
      { question: "Why is the Basilica important to art history?", answer: "Giotto's frescoes here marked the transition from medieval to <a href=\"/apps/masterpieces/movement/renaissance\"><strong>Renaissance</strong></a> painting. His use of perspective, emotion, and naturalistic figures influenced every major artist who followed, from Masaccio to Michelangelo." },
      { question: "Was the Basilica damaged in the earthquake?", answer: "The <strong>1997 earthquakes</strong> caused vault collapses that killed four people and damaged sections of the frescoes. The basilica closed for two years while restorers pieced together fragments. Most of Giotto's cycle survived intact." },
      { question: "Is the Basilica a UNESCO World Heritage Site?", answer: "Yes, UNESCO inscribed Assisi and the Basilica in <strong>2000</strong>, calling it a fundamental reference point for Italian and European art development. The organization described it as a masterpiece of human creative genius." },
      { question: "What can visitors see inside?", answer: "The Lower Church contains St. Francis's tomb beneath the altar. The Upper Church displays <a href=\"/apps/masterpieces/artist/giotto-di-bondone\"><strong>Giotto</strong></a>'s famous fresco cycle. Both levels feature works by major medieval and early Renaissance painters." }

Textile industrialist <strong>Samuel Courtauld</strong> began collecting French modern art in 1922 when many dismissed it as worthless. Within a decade, he had acquired Manet's A Bar at the Folies-Bergère, Van Gogh's Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear, and a remarkable group of eight Cézannes. He founded the Courtauld Institute in 1932 to train art historians using original works rather than just photographs.</p>

The Princes Gate Collection, added in 1978, brought Old Masters including works by Rubens, Bruegel, and Van Dyck.

When it opened in 1836, it was the largest museum building in the world and soon became a model for galleries across Europe, influencing the Hermitage in St. Petersburg and museums in Rome and Brussels. The Wittelsbach family had collected paintings since the 1500s, and Ludwig added aggressively, purchasing the Boisserée collection of 216 Old German and Dutch masters in 1827 and the Wallerstein collection two years later.</p>
