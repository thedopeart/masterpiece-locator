    bioFull: `<p><a href="/movement/rococo"><strong>Rococo</strong></a> painter <strong>Jean-Antoine Watteau</strong> (1684-1721) invented the fête galante genre, depicting aristocratic figures in dreamy pastoral settings suffused with theatrical atmosphere. Born in Valenciennes, he moved to Paris around 1702 and studied under Claude Gillot, whose work as an opera set designer shaped Watteau's lifelong interest in theater and commedia dell'arte characters. His paintings feature elegantly dressed figures in lush imaginary landscapes, their amorous encounters creating mood rather than narrative.</p>

<p>Watteau's breakthrough came in 1717 when the Académie royale created a new category specifically for his work, admitting him as a painter of fêtes galantes based on <strong>The Pilgrimage to the Island of Cythera</strong>. Despite chronic illness that would claim his life at 36, he produced work of profound influence. His loose brushwork and atmospheric effects anticipated Impressionism by over a century. Artists from François Boucher to J.M.W. Turner drew inspiration from his techniques. Today his paintings hang at the <a href="/museum/louvre"><strong>Louvre</strong></a> in Paris, the <a href="/museum/hermitage"><strong>Hermitage</strong></a> in St. Petersburg, the <a href="/museum/wallace-collection"><strong>Wallace Collection</strong></a> in London, and the <a href="/museum/charlottenburg-palace"><strong>Charlottenburg Palace</strong></a> in Berlin, which holds a second version of the Cythera painting.</p>`,

Born in Amersfoort, Netherlands, he trained at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam before moving through Impressionism, Symbolism, and Cubism toward his signature style. In 1917, he cofounded De Stijl with Theo van Doesburg, developing what he called <strong>Neoplasticism</strong>, a form limited to primary colors, black, white, and gray arranged in horizontal and vertical lines.</p>

<p>Mondrian believed this reduction to essentials could express universal beauty and spiritual harmony. His iconic grid paintings, with their asymmetrical arrangements of colored rectangles, influenced not just art but architecture, design, and fashion throughout the 20th century. Fleeing Nazi-occupied Europe, he spent his final years in New York, where jazz inspired looser works like <strong>Broadway Boogie-Woogie</strong> (1942-43).
