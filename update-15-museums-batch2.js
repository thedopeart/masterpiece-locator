    description: `<p>The Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden ranks among Europe's most prestigious Old Master collections, built largely through the ambitions of two art-loving rulers. Augustus II "the Strong" and his son Frederick Augustus II transformed Saxony's modest art holdings into a world-class collection between 1694 and 1763. In 1754, Frederick Augustus paid a record sum to acquire <a href="/apps/masterpieces/artist/raphael"><strong>Raphael</strong></a>'s <a href="/apps/masterpieces/art/sistine-madonna"><strong>Sistine Madonna</strong></a> from a church in Piacenza. The king reportedly moved his throne to better view the painting when it arrived.</p>

<p>The gallery's current home in the Semper Gallery wing of the Zwinger palace opened in 1855, designed by architect Gottfried Semper. <a href="/apps/masterpieces/artist/johannes-vermeer"><strong>Vermeer</strong></a>'s <a href="/apps/masterpieces/art/johannes-vermeer-girl-reading-a-letter-at-an-open-window"><strong>Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window</strong></a> and <a href="/apps/masterpieces/art/johannes-vermeer-the-procuress"><strong>The Procuress</strong></a> represent Dutch mastery, while <a href="/apps/masterpieces/artist/canaletto"><strong>Canaletto</strong></a>'s views of Venice and Dresden fill an entire gallery. The museum holds the world's largest collection of paintings by Lucas Cranach the Elder and Younger, totaling 58 works. World War II bombing devastated the building in 1945, and Soviet troops transported the surviving paintings to Moscow and Kiev. The collection returned in 1955, and extensive renovations completed in 2020 restored the galleries to their former grandeur.</p>`,
