Working in Middelburg, he specialized in small-scale works featuring simple subjects: a bundle of asparagus, wild strawberries on a stone ledge, or a few shells against a dark background. His minimalist approach and careful attention to light give these humble objects a quiet monumentality. Unlike other Dutch still life painters who filled their canvases with expensive objects, Coorte found beauty in simplicity.</p><p>Little is known about Coorte's life. He was likely a pupil of Melchior d'Hondecoeter around 1680 in Amsterdam and became a member of Middelburg's Guild of Saint Luke in 1695. About 80 signed works have been catalogued, most painted between 1683 and 1707. His career was nearly forgotten until Dutch art historian Laurens J. Bol rediscovered him in the 1950s. Today his small paintings hang in major museums including the <a href="/museum/rijksmuseum"><strong>Rijksmuseum</strong></a> in Amsterdam, the <a href="/museum/national-gallery-of-art"><strong>National Gallery of Art</strong></a> in Washington, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.

Born in Torzhok, Russia, he left the Imperial Guard to pursue art, eventually settling in Munich where he became a central figure in the German avant-garde. His portraits use bold, contrasting colors and directional brushstrokes to convey spiritual intensity.

Exposure to Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, and Henri Matisse at Paris exhibitions shaped his bold color sense. In 1909, he co-founded the Munich New Artists' Association, and in 1912 he joined Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider).

From 1518 to 1546, he designed Old Testament scenes for the marble pavement of Siena Cathedral, one of the most ambitious decorative projects of the Italian Renaissance.

His monumental "Maestà" altarpiece (1308-1311), originally created for Siena Cathedral's main altar, was carried in triumph through the streets when completed.
