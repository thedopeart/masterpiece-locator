    description: `<p><a href="/artist/peter-paul-rubens"><strong>Peter Paul Rubens</strong></a> painted this monumental triptych between 1612 and 1614 for the Confraternity of the Arquebusiers in Antwerp. The central panel depicts Christ's body being lowered from the cross, wrapped in a luminous white shroud that cuts diagonally through the composition. Nine figures work together to support the weight, their faces showing grief and tenderness.</p>
<p>The guild's patron saint was St. Christopher, meaning "Christ-bearer." All three interior scenes show Christ being physically carried: the Visitation on the left wing, the Presentation in the Temple on the right, and this <strong>central Descent</strong>. Rubens had just returned from Italy, and Italian influences are everywhere: rich Venetian colors, Caravaggio's dramatic lighting, and the muscular perfection of classical sculpture.</p>
<p>The altarpiece had a turbulent history. French forces took it to the Louvre in 1794, returning it only after Napoleon's defeat. German soldiers seized it again in 1914, keeping both Rubens triptychs in Berlin until the 1918 Armistice. Today it remains in its original location at the <a href="/museum/antwerp-cathedral"><strong>Cathedral of Our Lady</strong></a> in Antwerp, one of the finest examples of <a href="/movement/baroque"><strong>Baroque</strong></a> religious painting.</p>`,

Ten life-sized figures crowd into a shallow, gilded space that resembles a carved wooden shrine. The Virgin Mary swoons at the feet of St. John, her limp body echoing the diagonal of Christ's corpse above.</p>
<p>The <strong>Greater Guild of Crossbowmen</strong> in Leuven commissioned this for their chapel. Look closely at Christ's bent body: it curves like a crossbow, a subtle nod to the patrons. The raw emotion on each face is remarkable for its time. Mary Magdalene wrings her hands, Joseph of Arimathea steadies the body, and tears stream down several faces.</p>
<p>Mary of Hungary acquired the painting in the 16th century. It eventually passed to King Philip II of Spain, who sent it to the Monastery of El Escorial. After a 1992 restoration supervised by experts from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the painting returned to full glory at the <a href="/museum/prado"><strong>Museo del Prado</strong></a> in Madrid.

The goddess Diana sits on silk fabric beside a pool, a nymph attending her. Rather than the strong, bow-wielding huntress of mythology, Boucher presents her as charmingly innocent, unaware of being watched. Her hunting spoils lie nearby: a hare and two doves, the latter traditionally symbols of Venus.</p>
<p>The painting captures everything about <a href="/movement/rococo"><strong>Rococo</strong></a> style: glossy surfaces, a palette favoring <a href="https://luxurywallart.com/collections/blue-wall-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>soft blues</strong></a> and <a href="https://luxurywallart.com/collections/pink-wall-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>pinks</strong></a>, playful grace, and barely concealed eroticism.

He first painted the tower between 1909 and 1912, then returned to the subject with new approaches in the 1920s.</p>
<p>His early tower paintings fracture the structure into faceted, Cubist forms that seem to dissolve into the surrounding city. But Delaunay pushed beyond Cubism's brown and <a href="https://luxurywallart.com/collections/black-and-white-artwork" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>black palette</strong></a> toward vibrant color, co-founding a movement called Orphism with his wife Sonia. As she wrote, "The Tower was his liberated muse, his Eve of the future."</p>
<p>The Eiffel Tower represented everything modern: erected in 1889, it was then the world's tallest building, looming over classical Paris. For Delaunay and other modernists, it symbolized the dawn of the machine age.

Four shepherds gather around an austere tomb in an idealized pastoral landscape, tracing an inscription: "Et in Arcadia Ego." The Latin translates roughly to "Even in Arcadia, I exist," with the "I" traditionally understood as Death itself.</p>
<p>Poussin made an earlier version in 1627, now at Chatsworth House, showing the shepherds in dramatic confrontation with mortality. This later <a href="/museum/louvre"><strong>Louvre</strong></a> version is quieter, more contemplative. The figures meditate solemnly rather than react with shock. A skull from the earlier version has been removed, and one shepherd traces his companion's shadow on the stone, a gesture linked to the ancient origin of painting described by Pliny.</p>
<p>Arcadia was the mythical land of perfect happiness. Poussin, the leading painter of <a href="/movement/baroque"><strong>classical French Baroque</strong></a>, transforms the memento mori into something gentler: not a warning about death's presence, but a meditation on a beautiful past.

Leighton originally conceived her as decoration for a marble bath in another painting but became so attached to the design he made it a work of its own.</p>
<p>Leighton was Victorian Britain's most eminent artist: painter, sculptor, president of the Royal Academy, and the only British artist ever ennobled. Critics at the 1895 Royal Academy exhibition called Flaming June one of his finest works. The Graphic magazine bought it, creating a high-quality reproduction as a Christmas gift that year. When Leighton died in January 1896, they displayed it in their office window as his funeral procession passed.</p>

Morning mist rises from the glassy water, creating the luminous atmosphere that defines American Luminism.</p>
<p>Bingham originally titled the work "French Trader & Half breed Son." The American Art-Union, which exhibited and distributed the painting, changed it to avoid controversy.

<p>William Bingham, a wealthy Philadelphia merchant, commissioned the portrait as a gift for William Petty, Marquess of Lansdowne, who had supported the colonial cause during the Revolution. Stuart drew from European traditions of state portraiture while adding American elements: the table leg carved as a Roman fasces, a rainbow symbolizing peace after war, and Washington's own coat of arms on the silver inkwell.</p>
<p>Washington's stiff expression comes from his famous false teeth, as Stuart himself noted.

<p>Artemisia was raped at 17 by painter Agostino Tassi, her father's colleague. The subsequent trial included torture to test her testimony.

Five nude <a href="https://luxurywallart.com/collections/women-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>women</strong></a> confront the viewer with angular, fractured bodies and faces inspired by Iberian sculpture and African masks. The figures on the right show particularly stark geometric distortion, their features seemingly hacked apart and reassembled.</p>
<p>The title, meaning "The Young Ladies of Avignon," refers to a street in Barcelona's red-light district. Picasso originally called it "The Brothel of Avignon." He prepared obsessively, creating hundreds of sketches and studies over six months, more preparatory work than perhaps any artist had done for a single painting.</p>
<p>Even Picasso's inner circle was horrified. He kept the painting in his studio for years before exhibiting it in 1916. Critics remained hostile for decades. But art historians now see it as the birth of <a href="/movement/cubism"><strong>Cubism</strong></a> and the death blow to 500 years of Renaissance perspective.

    description: `<p><a href="/artist/james-mcneill-whistler"><strong>James McNeill Whistler</strong></a> painted this atmospheric night scene around 1875, depicting fireworks at Cremorne Gardens, a London pleasure resort. Sparks of <a href="https://luxurywallart.com/collections/gold-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>gold</strong></a> scatter across a deep <a href="https://luxurywallart.com/collections/black-and-white-artwork" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>black</strong></a> and blue background. The subject is barely recognizable: a few figures, a distant shore, and the exploding firework.</p>
<p>When exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1877, critic John Ruskin attacked it viciously, accusing Whistler of "flinging a pot of paint in the public's face." Whistler sued for libel. At trial, when asked how long the painting took, he answered "two days." The lawyer scoffed: "The labour of two days, then, is that for which you ask two hundred guineas!" Whistler's famous reply: "No. I ask it for the knowledge of a lifetime."</p>
<p>Whistler won but was awarded only a farthing in damages. Legal costs bankrupted him. Yet three years later, the painting sold for 800 guineas, four times his original asking price. The trial positioned Whistler as a forerunner of modern art, defending artistic vision against conventional expectations. The painting is now at the <a href="/museum/detroit-institute-of-arts"><strong>Detroit Institute of Arts</strong></a>.</p>`,

    description: `<p><a href="/artist/jackson-pollock"><strong>Jackson Pollock</strong></a> created this monumental canvas in 1948, one of his earliest fully realized drip paintings. Working on unstretched canvas laid on the studio floor, he dripped, poured, and flung paint using sticks and hardened brushes. The result is a dense web of lines in <a href="https://luxurywallart.com/collections/black-and-white-artwork" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>black</strong></a>, white, and subtle colors, including handprints visible in the upper right.</p>
<p>Pollock mixed artist-quality oils with industrial enamel house paints, breaking every rule of fine art materials. He abandoned the easel entirely, walking around and within the canvas, claiming he could "literally be in the painting." His wife Lee Krasner explained why he stopped using titles: "Numbers are neutral."</p>
<p>The <a href="/museum/moma"><strong>Museum of Modern Art</strong></a> acquired the painting in 1950, the first Pollock drip painting to enter their collection. A 1958 fire in an adjacent gallery exposed it to smoke damage. Conservation revealed that the handprints, always visible, were more prominent than previously thought, showing how Pollock used his own body as a painting tool.</p>`,

The figures display the artist's extraordinary technical skill: luminous skin tones, flowing hair, and precisely rendered anatomy. The satyr resists, fearful of water.</p>
<p>Bouguereau exhibited the painting at the 1873 Paris Salon alongside a verse from the Roman poet Statius: "Conscious of his shaggy hide and from childhood untaught to swim, he dares not trust himself to deep waters." One critic called it "the greatest painting of our generation." American collector John Wolfe purchased it for 35,000 francs.</p>
<p>After Wolfe's death, the painting hung in the bar of New York's Hoffman House Hotel until 1901. A later buyer, finding it "offensive," stored it in a warehouse. Robert Sterling Clark discovered it there and acquired it in 1942.
