    bioFull: `<p><a href="/movement/rococo"><strong>Rococo</strong></a> painter <strong>Jean-Baptiste Greuze</strong> (1725-1805) became famous for sentimental genre scenes that combined Dutch Realist detail with moral narratives. Born in Tournus, Burgundy, he showed a passion for drawing from age eight, eventually training at the Académie Royale in Paris. His 1755 Salon debut brought great success with paintings depicting virtuous family life and dramatic moral lessons. Works like "The Village Bride" (1761) and "The Punished Son" (1778) featured expressive faces and theatrical compositions that resonated deeply with Enlightenment audiences.</p><p>Greuze studied under Charles Grandon in Lyon before arriving in Paris, where he also spent a year at the Académie de France in Rome. His ambition to be recognized as a history painter led to conflict with the Academy, which admitted him only as a genre painter despite his submission of a historical subject. His sentimental scenes influenced later artists including Jacques-Louis David. Though celebrated during his lifetime, his reputation faded after the French Revolution, and he died in poverty at the Louvre, where he had been given quarters.
