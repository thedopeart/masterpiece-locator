        bioFull: "<p><strong>Hieronymus Bosch</strong> (c. 1450\u20131516) created some of the strangest, most unsettling images in Western art. Born Jheronimus van Aken in 's-Hertogenbosch, a town in the Duchy of Brabant (now the Netherlands), he took his surname from his birthplace. His grandfather, father, and four uncles were all painters. By 1481 he had married Aleid van de Meervenne, a wealthy woman whose fortune allowed him financial independence. He joined the Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady, a religious confraternity, and remained in 's-Hertogenbosch his entire life.</p>\n\n<p>Bosch's paintings overflow with bizarre hybrid creatures, demons, and <a href=\"https://luxurywallart.com/collections/macabre-art\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>macabre</strong></a> imagery that still puzzles scholars. His three great triptychs, <em>The Garden of Earthly Delights</em>, <em>The Haywain</em>, and <em>The Temptation of St. Anthony</em>, depict humanity's moral corruption with hallucinatory detail. His hell scenes feature fish swallowing men, musical instruments used as torture devices, and demons dressed as nuns. No clear documentary evidence explains his symbolism, and his meaning has been debated for centuries. Some see him as a <a href=\"/movement/northern-renaissance\"><strong>Northern Renaissance</strong></a> moralist warning against sin. Others have called him a heretic, an alchemist, or simply a genius entertainer.</p>\n\n<p>Philip II of Spain acquired many of Bosch's paintings, which explains why the <a href=\"/museum/prado\"><strong>Museo del Prado</strong></a> in Madrid holds the finest collection. <em>The Garden of Earthly Delights</em> hung at El Escorial for 342 years before moving to the Prado in 1939. Other works survive at the <a href=\"/museum/national-gallery\"><strong>National Gallery</strong></a> in London and the <a href=\"/museum/met\"><strong>Metropolitan Museum of Art</strong></a> in New York. Only about 25 paintings are confidently attributed to him today. His imagery later influenced Pieter Bruegel the Elder and, centuries later, Salvador Dal\u00ED and the Surrealists.</p>",

            { question: "What art movement was Hieronymus Bosch part of?", answer: "Bosch worked during the <a href=\"/movement/northern-renaissance\"><strong>Northern Renaissance</strong></a>, but his fantastical, nightmarish imagery stands apart from his contemporaries.

Born in Baarle, a village near Antwerp and Breda, he purchased citizenship in Bruges on July 6, 1444, exactly three years after van Eyck died. Had he been van Eyck's apprentice, guild rules would have granted him citizenship automatically after one year. So while he inherited van Eyck's position, he may not have been his student. Recent scholarship suggests his work shows equal influence from Dirk Bouts, Robert Campin, and Rogier van der Weyden.</p>\n\n<p>Christus made lasting contributions to <a href=\"/movement/northern-renaissance\"><strong>Early Netherlandish</strong></a> painting. His 1457 <em>Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints Francis and Jerome</em> is the first Northern painting to demonstrate accurate linear perspective, a technique he may have learned through Italian merchants in Bruges. Nearly half his paintings were commissioned by Italians or soon copied in Italy and Spain. His <em>Portrait of a Carthusian</em> (1446) and <em>Portrait of a Young Girl</em> (c. 1470) broke new ground by placing figures against detailed backgrounds rather than flat surfaces.</p>\n\n<p>About 30 paintings are now attributed to him, with the <a href=\"/museum/met\"><strong>Metropolitan Museum of Art</strong></a> holding five of them. The <a href=\"/museum/groeningemuseum\"><strong>Groeningemuseum</strong></a> in Bruges displays key works. His <em>Last Judgment</em>, commissioned by the Florentine Angelo Tani in 1467, was captured by pirates en route to Italy and ended up in Gda\u0144sk, where it remains at the National Museum.

Born in Greifswald on the Baltic coast, he was the sixth of ten children raised by a candle-maker and soap boiler. Tragedy struck early. When Friedrich was thirteen, he watched his younger brother drown after falling through the ice of a frozen lake while they were skating. Some accounts say Friedrich tried to save him. This loss shadowed his life and may explain the melancholy that pervades his work.</p>\n\n<p>Friedrich studied at the Copenhagen Academy from 1794 to 1798, then settled permanently in Dresden. His <a href=\"https://luxurywallart.com/collections/landscapes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>landscapes</strong></a> show solitary figures contemplating vast natural scenes: fog-shrouded mountains, moonlit beaches, ruined Gothic churches, gnarled trees against twilight skies. His <em>Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog</em> (c. 1818), showing a man with his back to the viewer gazing over swirling mist, became the defining image of Romantic individualism. He often used the R\u00FCckenfigur technique, depicting figures from behind so viewers could project themselves into the scene.</p>\n\n<p>Friedrich was appointed professor at the Dresden Academy in 1824. But his reputation declined as Romanticism gave way to Realism. A stroke in 1835 left him partially paralyzed, and a second stroke in 1837 ended his painting career.

Born in Paris, the son of a cabinetmaker, he rarely left the city his entire life. He apprenticed with the history painter Pierre-Jacques Cazes, then studied seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish paintings, especially the vanitas still lifes of Pieter Claesz. In 1728, at age twenty-eight, he was received into the Acad\u00E9mie Royale as \"a painter skilled in animals and fruits.\" He presented <em>The Ray</em> and <em>The Buffet</em>, both now at the <a href=\"/museum/louvre\"><strong>Louvre</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p>Chardin's <a href=\"https://luxurywallart.com/collections/minimalist-art\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>simple scenes</strong></a> of copper pots, bread loaves, glasses of water, and kitchen utensils glow with quiet dignity. His technique was unique: a granular impasto that catches light in ways that seem to give objects an inner radiance. Where his contemporaries favored grand history paintings, Chardin found the profound in the ordinary. By the 1730s he had expanded into genre scenes of domestic life, painting governesses, children blowing bubbles, and women sealing letters.</p>\n\n<p>Chardin served the Acad\u00E9mie for fifty years as counsellor, treasurer, and secretary, and by 1770 had become Premier peintre du roi with the Academy's highest pension. In 1757 Louis XV granted him a studio in the Louvre itself. When his eyesight failed in the 1770s, he turned to pastels, producing striking self-portraits that now hang at the Louvre. He died in 1779, and his reputation faded until the Goncourt brothers rediscovered him in the mid-nineteenth century. \u00C9douard Manet and Paul C\u00E9zanne studied his work closely, and Henri Matisse copied four of his paintings as a student.

        bioFull: "<p><strong>Joachim Patinir</strong> (c. 1480\u20131524) invented a new kind of painting: the \"world landscape.\" Born in Dinant or Bouvignes in what is now Wallonia, Belgium, he registered with Antwerp's Guild of Saint Luke in 1515 and remained there for the rest of his short life. Albrecht D\u00FCrer attended his wedding in 1521 and called him \"der gute Landschaftsmaler\" (the good landscape painter), coining a German word for this new specialty. Patinir may have trained in Bruges with Gerard David, traveling to Genoa with David and Adrien Ysenbrandt in 1511.</p>\n\n<p>Patinir's vast panoramic <a href=\"https://luxurywallart.com/collections/landscapes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>landscapes</strong></a> sweep from detailed foregrounds through layered planes of color to distant blue horizons. He pioneered aerial perspective in Northern painting, using warm brown-ochre tones in the foreground that transition to greens in the middle ground and cool blues in the background. His rocky outcrops, inspired by the dramatic formations near his native Dinant, became a trademark copied by later painters who never saw the originals. The small religious figures that populate his scenes often feel secondary to the vast natural world surrounding them.</p>\n\n<p>Patinir collaborated with other artists, including Quentin Metsys, who added figures to his landscapes. His <em>Landscape with Charon Crossing the Styx</em> shows the mythological ferryman navigating between paradise and hell, a typical blend of Northern landscape and symbolic meaning. Only five signed paintings survive, but many others are attributed to him or his workshop. The <a href=\"/museum/prado\"><strong>Museo del Prado</strong></a> in Madrid holds the finest collection, including several major works.

The family name sounded like \"laborer\" (macero) in Spanish, so he adopted the patronymic Juan de Juanes to distinguish himself. His contemporaries called him the \"second Raphael\" for his idealized figures and smooth technique, though he may never have visited Italy, absorbing Raphael's influence through prints and Italian paintings arriving in Valencia.</p>\n\n<p>Juan de Juanes devoted his entire career to <a href=\"https://luxurywallart.com/collections/spiritual-art\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>religious painting</strong></a>. He never painted a secular subject. According to tradition, he never put brush to canvas without first receiving holy communion, treating painting as a form of prayer. His <em>Last Supper</em>, showing Christ administering the Eucharist, established the image of Christ holding the sacred host that became standard in Spanish religious art. He worked for the churches of Jesuits, Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians, and the cathedral of Valencia. His most famous painting, <em>The Immaculate Conception</em>, reportedly derived from a vision experienced by his confessor.</p>\n\n<p>His sons and daughters also became painters, making the Masip family a Valencian painting dynasty.

His father, a painter, trained him, and by 1502 he was working in Vienna, where his romanticized devotional paintings set against Alpine landscapes established his early reputation. These works made him a pioneer of the Danube School of landscape painting.</p>\n\n<p>In 1505, Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony, appointed Cranach court painter at Wittenberg, offering two and a half times the salary of his predecessor. Cranach remained there for forty-five years, becoming one of Wittenberg's leading citizens. He owned houses, an apothecary, and a publishing firm that specialized in Reformation literature. He served repeatedly on the city council and as burgomaster. Most importantly, he became a close friend of Martin Luther. He served as best man at Luther's wedding to Katharina von Bora (a former nun whom Cranach had sheltered after she fled her convent) and became godfather to Luther's first son.
