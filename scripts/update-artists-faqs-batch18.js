Unlike male artists who idealized motherhood, she portrayed these moments with psychological depth and dignity, treating her subjects as individuals rather than sentimental types." },

His intellectual approach made him \"the painter-philosopher\" and established principles that would dominate French art for two centuries." },
      { question: "Where can I see Poussin's paintings?", answer: "The <a href=\"/apps/masterpieces/museum/louvre\"><strong>Louvre</strong></a> in Paris holds the world's largest Poussin collection, including his two Bacchanal series. Major works also hang at the <a href=\"/apps/masterpieces/museum/national-gallery\"><strong>National Gallery</strong></a> London, <a href=\"/apps/masterpieces/museum/metropolitan-museum-of-art\"><strong>Metropolitan Museum</strong></a>, and the Dulwich Picture Gallery. His paintings rarely leave these institutions." },
      { question: "Why is Poussin called the painter-philosopher?", answer: "Poussin took an intellectual approach to painting, carefully planning compositions to convey moral and philosophical ideas drawn from ancient history, mythology, and scripture. He believed art should appeal to the mind, not just the eye. His theoretical writings and rigorous methods influenced academies across Europe for generations." },
      { question: "Where did Poussin live and work?", answer: "Though French, Poussin spent most of his career in Rome, arriving in 1624. A brief return to Paris as <strong>First Painter to Louis XIII</strong> (1640-42) proved frustrating. The court's decorative demands conflicted with his contemplative style. He returned to Rome permanently, where he died in 1665." },
      { question: "Who did Poussin influence?", answer: "Poussin's classical approach influenced <a href=\"/apps/masterpieces/artist/jacques-louis-david\"><strong>Jacques-Louis David</strong></a>, <a href=\"/apps/masterpieces/artist/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres\"><strong>Ingres</strong></a>, and the entire Neoclassical movement.

      { question: "What is distinctive about Botticelli's style?", answer: "Botticelli used flowing, lyrical lines to create ethereal figures with <strong>diaphanous drapery</strong> and graceful poses. His work emphasizes beauty and decorative elegance over strict naturalism. The elongated proportions and sinuous contours of his <a href=\"https://luxurywallart.com/collections/women-art\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>female figures</strong></a> became his signature, influencing Pre-Raphaelites four centuries later." },
      { question: "What subjects did Botticelli paint?", answer: "Botticelli painted mythological scenes for private Medici villas, <a href=\"https://luxurywallart.com/collections/portrait-art\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>portraits</strong></a> of Florentine nobility, and numerous religious works including altarpieces and frescoes.

      { question: "Who were Stuck's famous students?", answer: "At the Munich Academy, Stuck taught <strong>Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee,</strong> and Josef Albers, future pioneers of abstract and modern art. His rigorous technical training and symbolist vision helped shape artists who would later revolutionize 20th-century painting in radically different directions." },
      { question: "What is Stuck's most famous painting?", answer: "<strong>The Sin</strong> (1893) depicts a pale woman entwined with a massive serpent, her dark eyes meeting the viewer's gaze.
