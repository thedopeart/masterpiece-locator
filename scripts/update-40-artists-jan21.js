    bioFull: `<p><a href="/movement/academic-art"><strong>Academic</strong></a> painter <strong>Charles Auguste Emile Durand</strong>, known as Carolus-Duran (1837-1917), became one of the most sought-after portrait painters in late 19th-century Paris. Born in Lille, France, he adopted his professional name early in his career and developed a distinctive style influenced by Spanish masters, particularly Diego Velázquez. His portraits of fashionable Parisian society earned him the nickname "The Prince of Color" from Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. Works like "Lady with the Glove" (1869) showcase his ability to capture both the elegance of his subjects and the rich textures of their clothing.</p><p>Carolus-Duran trained at the Académie de Lille before moving to Paris, where he studied at the Académie Suisse. A pivotal trip to Rome and Spain between 1862 and 1866 transformed his approach, as he absorbed the techniques of Velázquez and other Old Masters. In 1873, he opened his own teaching studio, which attracted students from across Europe and America. His most famous pupil was <strong>John Singer Sargent</strong>, who later credited Carolus-Duran's direct painting method for shaping his own career. The French government recognized his achievements by making him Commander of the Legion of Honor in 1889, and he served as Director of the French Academy in Rome from 1905 to 1913.

Born in Pochinok, Russia, he studied architecture in Germany after being rejected from Russian art academies due to anti-Jewish quotas. His "Proun" series, beginning in 1919, broke new ground by treating geometric compositions as bridges between painting and architecture. These abstract works explored three-dimensional space on a flat surface, influencing everything from graphic design to exhibition architecture.</p><p>Lissitzky's career took a decisive turn in 1919 when Marc Chagall invited him to teach at the People's Art School in Vitebsk.
