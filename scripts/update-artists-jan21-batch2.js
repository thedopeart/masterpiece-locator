      bioFull: `<p>Swedish painter <strong>Anders Zorn</strong> (1860-1920) became one of the most sought-after <a href="/movement/impressionism"><strong>Impressionist</strong></a> portrait artists in Europe and America. Born in Mora, in the Dalarna region of Sweden, he grew up in humble circumstances on a small farm raised by his mother and grandparents. His talent showed early: at 15, he gained admission to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Stockholm. Zorn built his reputation painting watercolor portraits in London during the early 1880s, where he also learned etching from Axel Herman Haig. By 1887, he'd switched firmly to oils, developing a sure-handed approach to color and tone that made his portraits feel alive. His work earned him both a first-class medal and the Legion of Honor at the 1889 Paris World's Fair.</p>

<p>Zorn's portrait commissions took him to the highest levels of society. He painted King Oscar II of Sweden and three American presidents: Grover Cleveland, William H. Taft, and Theodore Roosevelt. In Paris, critics compared him favorably to John Singer Sargent as a chronicler of glittering high society. Beyond <a href="https://luxurywallart.com/collections/portrait-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>portraits</strong></a>, Zorn produced remarkable etchings, with 289 documented works showing his mastery of dramatic light and shade. He created an unorthodox, impressionistic style using squalls of lines that became instantly recognizable. After working abroad for years, Zorn returned to Mora in 1896 and built Zorngården, his residence and studio, completed in 1910. He and his wife Emma donated their entire estate to the Swedish State after his death. Today, the <a href="/museum/nationalmuseum-stockholm"><strong>Nationalmuseum</strong></a> in Stockholm holds many of his important works, with additional pieces at the <a href="/museum/metropolitan-museum-of-art"><strong>Metropolitan Museum of Art</strong></a> and the <a href="/museum/musee-dorsay"><strong>Musée d'Orsay</strong></a>.</p>`,

      bioFull: `<p><strong>Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun</strong> (1755-1842) became the most celebrated <a href="https://luxurywallart.com/collections/portrait-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>portrait</strong></a> painter of 18th-century France and the official artist to Queen Marie Antoinette. Born in Paris, she was the daughter of a pastel portraitist who encouraged her artistic talents from childhood. Her style blended the grace and elegance of the declining <a href="/movement/rococo"><strong>Rococo</strong></a> period with the composure of emerging <a href="/movement/neoclassicism"><strong>Neoclassicism</strong></a>. She painted more than 30 portraits of the Queen and her family, including the controversial "Marie-Antoinette in a Muslin Dress" (1783), which sparked scandal at the Salon for its informal attire. Her later "Marie Antoinette and her Children" (1787) attempted to rehabilitate the Queen's public image by showing her as a devoted mother.</p>

<p>Vigée Le Brun joined the Académie de Saint-Luc in 1774 and was appointed official artist to Marie Antoinette four years later. Thanks largely to the queen's influence, she gained admission to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in 1783, despite rules limiting female membership. When the Revolution erupted in 1789, she fled France and spent 12 years abroad, painting portraits and moving through society in Rome, Naples, Vienna, Berlin, St. Petersburg, and Moscow. She was elected to art academies in ten cities across Europe. Contemporary artists like <strong>Joshua Reynolds</strong> viewed her as one of the greatest portraitists of the age. By her own count, she painted around 900 pictures during her career: some 600 portraits and about 200 <a href="https://luxurywallart.com/collections/landscapes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>landscapes</strong></a>. Her memoirs, published in the 1830s when she was in her eighties, provide a vivid account of artistic life before and after the Revolution. Her work hangs at the <a href="/museum/louvre"><strong>Louvre</strong></a>, the <a href="/museum/hermitage-museum"><strong>Hermitage</strong></a>, and the <a href="/museum/metropolitan-museum-of-art"><strong>Metropolitan Museum of Art</strong></a>.</p>`,

    data: {
      bioFull: `<p><a href="/movement/expressionism"><strong>Expressionist</strong></a> painter <strong>Ernst Ludwig Kirchner</strong> (1880-1938) co-founded Die Brücke ("The Bridge"), the radical artists' group that launched German Expressionism. Born in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria, he studied architecture at Dresden Technical High School starting in 1901, where he met Fritz Bleyl, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, and Erich Heckel. Together, they formed Die Brücke in 1905, aiming to create a "bridge" between classical motifs and the avant-garde. The group revived older media, particularly woodcut prints, responding to German masters like <strong>Albrecht Dürer</strong> while drawing inspiration from Edvard Munch and African art. Kirchner's mature style became known for its psychological tension, bold colors, and angular forms.</p>

<p>Kirchner moved to Berlin in 1911, where the modern city's energy and chaos became his primary subject. His street scenes of prostitutes and urban crowds captured the nervous intensity of pre-war Berlin with jagged brushwork and electric <a href="https://luxurywallart.com/collections/colorful-artwork" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>colors</strong></a>. He volunteered for army service in World War I but suffered a breakdown and was discharged. After recovering in Switzerland, his later <a href="https://luxurywallart.com/collections/landscapes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>landscapes</strong></a> showed humans at peace with nature, a stark contrast to his frenetic city paintings. The Nazis branded his work "degenerate" in 1933, and in 1937 they seized or destroyed more than 600 of his pieces. Deeply disturbed by Germany's annexation of Austria and fearing an invasion of Switzerland, Kirchner took his own life in June 1938. Today, the <a href="/museum/brucke-museum"><strong>Brücke-Museum</strong></a> in Berlin holds the most comprehensive collection of his work, with additional pieces at the <a href="/museum/moma"><strong>Museum of Modern Art</strong></a> and the <a href="/museum/tate"><strong>Tate</strong></a>.</p>`,

    data: {
      bioFull: `<p><a href="/movement/renaissance"><strong>Renaissance</strong></a> painter <strong>Filippo Lippi</strong> (c. 1406-1469) was one of the most influential Florentine masters of the Quattrocento and the teacher who shaped <strong>Sandro Botticelli</strong>. Born into poverty in Florence, young Filippo became an orphan at age two. An aunt raised him briefly before placing him in the Carmelite monastery at Santa Maria del Carmine. There, he witnessed Masaccio painting the Brancacci Chapel frescoes (c. 1423-27), some of the most influential paintings of the <a href="/movement/renaissance"><strong>Renaissance</strong></a>. These works became Lippi's first important contact with art. Despite taking religious vows, he proved a reluctant friar with a talent for getting into trouble.</p>

<p>Lippi's paintings caught the attention of the Medici family by the 1430s, and they became his primary patrons. Cosimo de' Medici even intervened when Lippi was imprisoned and tortured for alleged fraud. His most monumental works are the frescoes in the choir of Prato Cathedral, depicting the stories of <a href="https://luxurywallart.com/collections/spiritual-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Saint Stephen and Saint John the Baptist</strong></a>. His personal life caused scandal: despite being a friar, he had a love affair with a nun named Lucrezia Buti, who bore him a son (the painter Filippino Lippi) and a daughter. The Pope eventually released them from their vows, allowing them to marry. His Barbadori Altarpiece (begun 1437, now at the <a href="/museum/louvre"><strong>Louvre</strong></a>) is sometimes credited as the earliest example of the sacra conversazione format. Lippi died in 1469 while working on frescoes in Spoleto Cathedral. Lorenzo de' Medici commissioned his tomb there. Major works are held at the <a href="/museum/uffizi"><strong>Uffizi Gallery</strong></a>, the <a href="/museum/metropolitan-museum-of-art"><strong>Metropolitan Museum of Art</strong></a>, and the <a href="/museum/national-gallery-london"><strong>National Gallery</strong></a> in London.</p>`,

  // 5. Francisco Goya

    where: { slug: 'francisco-goya' },
    data: {
      bioFull: `<p><a href="/movement/romanticism"><strong>Romantic</strong></a> painter <strong>Francisco Goya</strong> (1746-1828) is often called both the last of the Old Masters and the first of the moderns. Born in Fuendetodos, Aragón, he studied painting from age 14 and later moved to Madrid to train with Anton Raphael Mengs. A trip to Italy in 1771 further developed his skills. By 1786, he'd been appointed court painter to King Charles III, and in 1799 he became First Painter to Charles IV. That same year, he published "Los Caprichos," a series of satirical prints targeting Spanish society. A severe illness in 1792 left him permanently deaf, an event that darkened his vision and led to increasingly personal, often disturbing imagery in his later work.</p>

<p>Goya's paintings document Spain's turbulent history with unflinching honesty. "The Third of May 1808" captures the execution of Spanish civilians by Napoleon's troops with brutal immediacy. His "Black Paintings," created between 1819-1823 directly on the walls of his home, stand among the most haunting works in Western art. He never intended these 14 paintings for public display, never wrote about them, and likely never spoke of them. They were transferred to canvas around 1874, fifty years after his death. Goya produced around 700 paintings, 280 prints, and several thousand drawings, influencing movements from <a href="/movement/expressionism"><strong>Expressionism</strong></a> to <a href="/movement/surrealism"><strong>Surrealism</strong></a>. <strong>Picasso's</strong> "Guernica" owes a clear debt to Goya's war imagery. After fleeing Spain's oppressive regime in 1824, Goya died in Bordeaux in 1828. The <a href="/museum/museo-del-prado"><strong>Museo del Prado</strong></a> in Madrid holds the world's largest collection of his work, including the Black Paintings and "The Third of May 1808."</p>`,

Born in Hartford, Connecticut, to a wealthy family, he studied under <strong>Thomas Cole</strong> in the Catskill Mountains from 1844 to 1846. In 1849, at just 23, Church became the youngest artist ever elected to the National Academy of Design. His seven-foot-wide "Niagara" (1857) stunned audiences in New York and London with its combination of breadth and uncanny realism, establishing him as the most famous painter in America.</p>

<p>The naturalist Alexander von Humboldt's writings on South America inspired Church to travel to Ecuador in 1853 and 1857, painting tropical volcanoes and <a href="https://luxurywallart.com/collections/mountain-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>mountains</strong></a>. His ten-foot canvas "The Heart of the Andes" (1859) became the most popular display of a single artwork during the Civil War era, attracting 12,000 visitors in three weeks at its New York premiere. People paid admission to see it, viewing through opera glasses as if gazing into an actual window on the Andes. Church also traveled widely in Europe and the Middle East, painting icebergs, ancient ruins, and Mediterranean views. Crippling rheumatism in his hands forced him to abandon painting after 1877.

      bioFull: `<p>American realist <strong>George Bellows</strong> (1882-1925) captured the raw energy of early 20th-century New York with a boldness that made him the most acclaimed painter of his generation. Born in Columbus, Ohio, he attended Ohio State University, where his athletic talents suggested a possible career in professional baseball. Instead, he moved to New York in 1904 to study art with <strong>Robert Henri</strong>, one of America's most influential teachers. Bellows quickly became associated with the <strong>Ashcan School</strong>, a group of artists who painted contemporary American life in all its gritty reality, from crowded tenements to boxing clubs.</p>

<p>Though Bellows claimed to know nothing about boxing's rules, his fight paintings became his most celebrated works. "Stag at Sharkey's" (1909) depicts an illegal bout at Tom Sharkey's Athletic Club, located directly across Broadway from Bellows's studio. After New York banned public prizefighting in 1900, private clubs like Sharkey's sold memberships to let audiences gamble on matches legally. Outsiders who came to fight were given temporary membership and called "stags." Bellows's boxing scenes have been read as analogies for the trials of working-class urban survival, with their muscular bodies straining under harsh light. "Dempsey and Firpo" (1924) shows the solid modeling and geometric design that characterized his later style. Beyond boxing, Bellows painted <a href="https://luxurywallart.com/collections/coastal-decor" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>coastal scenes</strong></a>, urban crowds, and wartime subjects. He helped organize the landmark Armory Show of 1913 and produced nearly 200 lithographs from 1916 onward. He died unexpectedly in 1925 from a ruptured appendix at just 42.

His nickname means "The Squinting One," derived from a physical defect. Born in Cento near Bologna, he was largely self-taught but deeply influenced by Ludovico Carracci, whose "Madonna with St. Francis" in a local church he later cited as his greatest early inspiration. A trip to Venice in 1618 introduced him to the Venetian painting tradition, reflected in the velvety, glowing <a href="https://luxurywallart.com/collections/colorful-artwork" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>colors</strong></a> of his subsequent work.

<p>Pope Gregory XV, a native of Bologna, summoned Guercino to Rome during his brief reign (1621-1623). His fresco "Aurora" on the ceiling of the Casino Ludovisi is a spirited work painted to appear as if there were no ceiling at all, with the goddess's chariot seeming to move directly overhead. When the Pope died, Guercino returned to Cento. He moved to Bologna in 1642 after the death of <a href="/artist/guido-reni"><strong>Guido Reni</strong></a>, whose position as the city's leading painter had been unassailable, and remained there until his death. Guercino was remarkably prolific: he completed 106 large altarpieces and about 144 other paintings, and was also an accomplished draftsman. He never married, and his estate passed to his nephews. Today his works hang at the <a href="/museum/louvre"><strong>Louvre</strong></a>, the <a href="/museum/metropolitan-museum-of-art"><strong>Metropolitan Museum of Art</strong></a>, the <a href="/museum/national-gallery-london"><strong>National Gallery</strong></a> in London, and the <a href="/museum/museo-del-prado"><strong>Prado</strong></a>.</p>`,

      bioFull: `<p><a href="/movement/baroque"><strong>Baroque</strong></a> master <strong>Guido Reni</strong> (1575-1642) became the most famous Italian painter of his generation and the dominant figure of the Bolognese School. Born in Bologna, he was the only child of a singer and instrumentalist who worked for the local Signoria. He entered the workshop of Flemish painter Denis Calvaert at age 10, then moved to the Accademia degli Incamminati led by the Carracci brothers. There he formed the nucleus of the Bolognese school alongside Albani and Domenichino. During his early years in Rome, the fame of <a href="/artist/caravaggio"><strong>Caravaggio</strong></a> overwhelmed him. His "Crucifixion of St. Peter" (c. 1603) attempts to imitate Caravaggio's rough types and deep shadows while maintaining Bolognese classicism.</p>

<p>By 1609, Reni had abandoned this uneasy compromise and replaced Annibale Carracci as the leader of Baroque classicism in Rome. His "Aurora" fresco (1614) in the Casino of the Pallavicini-Rospigliosi palace is famous for its crisp, Hellenistic elegance. The Barberini family commissioned his "Archangel Michael" (1636) for Santa Maria della Concezione, an image that sparked a legend: some claimed Reni had painted the devil with the features of Cardinal Pamphilj as revenge for a slight. In Bologna, he ran two studios teeming with nearly 200 pupils. A compulsive gambler, Reni was often in financial distress despite steady demand for his <a href="https://luxurywallart.com/collections/spiritual-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>religious paintings</strong></a>. His late works show a distinctive silvery glow with ice blue, apple green, pink, and pearly grey. His influence spread through his many pupils and reached Spanish Baroque artists like Jusepe de Ribera and Murillo, as well as French painters Le Sueur, Le Brun, and Greuze. The <a href="/museum/pinacoteca-nazionale-bologna"><strong>Pinacoteca Nazionale</strong></a> in Bologna holds the largest collection of his work.</p>`,

  // 10. Jules Breton

    data: {
      bioFull: `<p>French <strong>Jules Breton</strong> (1827-1906) became one of the most celebrated painters of rural life in the 19th century, capturing peasant communities with warmth and dignity. Born in Courrières, a small village in the Pas-de-Calais region, he was the son of a land supervisor. His mother died when he was four, and he was raised by his father. A love of the land and respect for tradition remained central to his art throughout his life, providing the subjects for his major Salon compositions. He trained formally in Belgium under Félix de Vigne and Baron Gustave Wappers before moving to Paris in 1847 to study at the École des Beaux-Arts.</p>

<p>Breton exhibited "Return of the Reapers" in 1853, the first of many <a href="https://luxurywallart.com/collections/country-farm-paintings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>rural peasant scenes</strong></a> that made his reputation. Unlike the grittier realism of <strong>Jean-François Millet</strong>, Breton treated his peasant subjects in an <a href="/movement/academic-art"><strong>Academic</strong></a> style traditionally reserved for classical figures, lending them nobility and grace. His "Song of the Lark" (1884), showing a young peasant woman pausing at the edge of a field, became perhaps his most beloved work. Eleanor Roosevelt declared it her favorite painting when it was crowned "the most beloved work of art in America" at the 1934 Chicago World's Fair. Breton's subjects fall into four categories: labor, rest, rural festivals, and religious festivals. He was elected to the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1886 and also wrote several books, including poetry and memoirs about his artistic life. His work was immensely popular during his lifetime in France, England, and the United States. Today, "Song of the Lark" hangs at the <a href="/museum/art-institute-of-chicago"><strong>Art Institute of Chicago</strong></a>, with other works at the <a href="/museum/metropolitan-museum-of-art"><strong>Metropolitan Museum of Art</strong></a>.</p>`,
