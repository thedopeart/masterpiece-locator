    description: `<p>The <strong>Turin-Milan Hours</strong> ranks among the most important illuminated manuscripts in Western art history. Commissioned around 1380 or 1390, possibly by Jean, Duke of Berry, this book of hours contains miniatures attributed to <a href="/apps/masterpieces/artist/jan-van-eyck"><strong>Jan van Eyck</strong></a> or an artist working closely with him. <a href="/apps/masterpieces/museum/palazzo-madama-turin"><strong>Palazzo Madama</strong></a> in Turin now owns the surviving Turin fragment.</p><p>The original volume contained roughly 400 folios with at least 280 illuminations. It was divided in two: one part remained in France and now resides at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, while the second went to the Low Countries where work continued for three decades. Art historians identify several miniatures by an artist called "Hand G," whose sophisticated handling of <strong>light, atmosphere, and detail</strong> resembles Van Eyck's larger paintings.</p><p>A 1904 fire at Turin's National Library destroyed several of Hand G's pages, making surviving images even more precious. The manuscript features refined execution with delicate detail, rich color, and remarkable light effects. Turin acquired its fragment in 1935.</p>`,

    description: `<p><strong>Ecce Homo</strong> by <a href="/apps/masterpieces/artist/andrea-mantegna"><strong>Andrea Mantegna</strong></a> depicts the moment when Christ is presented to the crowd before his crucifixion. Painted around 1500, this tempera on canvas work now resides in the <a href="/apps/masterpieces/museum/musee-jacquemart-andre-paris"><strong>Musée Jacquemart-André</strong></a> in Paris. The composition is startlingly intimate: Christ appears in close-up, his body covered in whip marks, wrists bound, a rope knotted around his neck.</p><p>What makes this painting unusual is Christ's complete nudity, a departure from traditional <strong>Ecce Homo</strong> depictions. Mantegna used a subdued, almost grisaille-like palette to emphasize the sculptural quality of the figures. The flanking figures display exaggerated, almost caricatural expressions of fury and murderous intent. Their faces crowd the frame, creating a suffocating atmosphere that conveys the mob's rage. This tight composition, combined with Mantegna's unflinching portrayal of human cruelty, makes the work a powerful meditation on suffering and the darker aspects of human nature.</p>`,

The saint kneels on grassy ground dotted with blue and white flowers, strawberries, and plantain while gazing upward at a vision of the Crucified Christ held aloft by a six-winged seraph.</p><p>Van Eyck's microscopic technique allows extraordinary detail: imagery that appears both sharp and distant at once. In the foreground, <strong>Brother Leo</strong> sits dozing, unaware of the miracle unfolding behind him. A bustling Netherlandish city fills the background, suggesting the miracle exists outside the boundaries of time and geography.

The arc extends roughly eight feet, allowing the lamp to illuminate a dining table from the side of the room. A hole through the marble base lets two people carry it with a broomstick.
