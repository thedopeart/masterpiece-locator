      "question": "What is the history of the National Gallery?",
      "answer": "The National Gallery was founded in 1824 when the British government purchased 38 paintings from the heirs of banker John Julius Angerstein. Unlike continental European museums formed from royal collections, Britain's national gallery began with this private acquisition. The collection was first displayed in Angerstein's townhouse at 100 Pall Mall.<br><br>In 1831, Parliament resolved to build a permanent home on Trafalgar Square. The Neoclassical building, designed by Greek Revival architect William Wilkins, opened to the public in 1838. The collection grew through key acquisitions: Sir George Beaumont's collection arrived in 1826, and J.M.W. Turner left over 1,000 works in 1856.<br><br>The gallery expanded multiple times, most notably in 1991 with the Sainsbury Wing designed by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown. Sir Charles Lock Eastlake became the first director in 1855. The Sainsbury Wing reopened after a major renovation in 2025 as part of the gallery's 200th anniversary celebrations."

    {
      "question": "How long does it take to see the National Gallery?",
      "answer": "Plan for <strong>2-3 hours minimum</strong> to see the major highlights, including the Impressionist galleries, Renaissance rooms, and popular works like Sunflowers and the Arnolfini Portrait. A thorough exploration of multiple periods and wings requires <strong>4-6 hours</strong>, and dedicated art lovers could spend an entire day.<br><br>For shorter visits, the gallery offers three curated \"Art Routes\" that take 25-35 minutes each. A focused 90-minute \"greatest hits\" tour lets you see the most famous masterpieces. Many visitors find they can only concentrate for about 90 minutes at a stretch, so consider breaking up your visit with a coffee break.<br><br>The Impressionist galleries (Rooms 41-46) tend to be the busiest. Visit these first thing in the morning or during lunch (1pm-2:30pm) when tour groups disperse. Friday evenings after 6pm and weekday mornings are the quietest times."
