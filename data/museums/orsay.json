      "question": "What is the history of the Musée d'Orsay?",
      "answer": "The Musée d'Orsay occupies the former Gare d'Orsay, a railway station designed by architect Victor Laloux in the Beaux-Arts style. The station opened on May 28, 1900, just in time for the Paris World's Fair. It was the first electrified urban terminal station in the world and also contained a 370-room hotel.<br><br>The station served trains running to southwest France until 1939, when longer train cars made the platforms too short. After closing to long-distance traffic, the building served various purposes: a reception center for repatriated prisoners after WWII, and a backdrop for films by Orson Welles and Bernardo Bertolucci.<br><br>President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing announced the museum project in 1978. Italian architect Gae Aulenti designed the interior galleries, transforming the industrial space into an art museum. The Musée d'Orsay officially opened in December 1986 under President François Mitterrand. It was the first time an industrial building had been converted into a major museum."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to see the Musée d'Orsay?",
      "answer": "Most visitors should plan for <strong>2 to 4 hours</strong> at the Musée d'Orsay. If you want to see the highlights without feeling rushed, allocate at least 2 hours. Art enthusiasts who want to explore the collection more thoroughly often spend 5 to 6 hours. The museum displays roughly 3,000 works at any given time across multiple floors.<br><br>If you're short on time or primarily interested in the Impressionists, you can focus on the fifth floor galleries, where the core collection of <a href=\"/artist/claude-monet\" style=\"color: #C9A84C; font-weight: 600;\">Monet</a>, <a href=\"/artist/pierre-auguste-renoir\" style=\"color: #C9A84C; font-weight: 600;\">Renoir</a>, <a href=\"/artist/edgar-degas\" style=\"color: #C9A84C; font-weight: 600;\">Degas</a>, and other Impressionist masters is displayed. A quick tour of just this floor takes about 2 hours.<br><br>The museum is open from 9:30 AM to 6:00 PM most days, with extended hours until 9:45 PM on Thursdays. To avoid crowds, visit on Wednesday or Friday mornings, or take advantage of Thursday evening hours."

    {
      "question": "How much do tickets cost for the Musée d'Orsay?",
      "answer": "Standard admission to the Musée d'Orsay costs <strong>€16</strong>. This ticket includes access to both the permanent collections and any temporary exhibitions. For Thursday evening visits after 6:00 PM, a reduced rate of <strong>€12</strong> applies.<br><br>Free admission is available for visitors under 18 years old, EU and European Economic Area residents aged 18 to 25, visitors with disabilities and one accompanying person, and everyone on the first Sunday of each month.<br><br>The museum strongly recommends buying tickets online in advance. Without a pre-purchased ticket, expect wait times of around 50 minutes at the main entrance during busy periods. Tuesday tends to be the most crowded day since the Louvre is closed."

      "question": "What floor are the Impressionists on at the Musée d'Orsay?",
      "answer": "The famous Impressionist collection is located on the <strong>fifth floor</strong> of the Musée d'Orsay.

Some works, particularly in temporary exhibitions, may have individual photo restrictions.<br><br>Professional or commercial filming and photography requires authorization from the museum.

  "historicalContext": "The Gare d'Orsay railway station opened in 1900 to serve southwestern France and coincide with the World's Fair. Architect Victor Laloux designed it with a grand hotel facade hiding the iron-and-glass train shed behind Beaux-Arts stone. By 1939, electrified trains made the platforms too short, and the station closed to mainline traffic. The building served various purposes: a mail center during WWII, a filming location for Orson Welles' The Trial, and a theater venue. President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing saved it from demolition in 1977, commissioning its conversion to a museum dedicated to art from 1848-1914, bridging the gap between the Louvre and the Centre Pompidou. The Musée d'Orsay opened on December 1, 1986.",
