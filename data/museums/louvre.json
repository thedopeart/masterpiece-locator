    {
      "question": "What is the history of the Louvre Museum?",
      "answer": "The Louvre began as a medieval fortress built by King Philip II in 1190 to protect Paris. It was transformed into a royal palace in the 16th century under Francis I, who began the art collection.<br><br>The palace was abandoned when Louis XIV moved the court to Versailles in 1682. During the French Revolution in 1793, the Louvre opened as a public museum with 537 paintings.<br><br>Napoleon significantly expanded the collection through conquests. The iconic glass pyramid entrance, designed by I.M. Pei, was added in 1989. Today it holds over 380,000 objects and displays 35,000 works across 72,735 square meters."

    {
      "question": "How do I see the Mona Lisa without crowds?",
      "answer": "The <a href=\"/art/mona-lisa\" style=\"color: #028161; font-weight: 600;\">Mona Lisa</a> attracts millions of visitors yearly, making it challenging to view without crowds. Your best strategies: <strong>Arrive at 9am sharp</strong> when doors open and head straight to Room 711.<br><br>Alternatively, visit during <strong>Wednesday or Friday evening hours</strong> (6pm-9pm) when crowds thin significantly. Avoid weekends and summer months entirely. Enter through the less-crowded Porte des Lions entrance to save time.<br><br>Consider visiting in January, February, or November when tourist numbers drop. The painting is behind bulletproof glass about 6 meters from the viewing area, so manage expectations about getting close."

    {
      "question": "What sculptures should I see at the Louvre?",
      "answer": "Beyond paintings, the Louvre has world-class sculpture. The <strong>Winged Victory of Samothrace</strong> (Nike of Samothrace) commands the Daru Staircase, a 2nd-century BC Hellenistic masterpiece.<br><br>The <strong>Venus de Milo</strong> in Room 346 is an ancient Greek sculpture from around 100 BC, famous for her missing arms.

    {
      "question": "How long does it take to see the entire Louvre?",
      "answer": "You cannot see the entire Louvre in one visit. With 35,000 artworks on display across 15 acres, spending just 30 seconds at each piece would take over 100 days.<br><br><strong>For first-time visitors</strong>, plan 3-4 hours to see highlights like the <a href=\"/art/mona-lisa\" style=\"color: #028161; font-weight: 600;\">Mona Lisa</a>, Venus de Milo, and Winged Victory. <strong>Art enthusiasts</strong> should allocate a full day (6-8 hours) to explore one or two departments thoroughly.<br><br>Many visitors return multiple times, focusing on different collections: Egyptian antiquities, Italian paintings, French sculptures, or Islamic art. The museum offers themed trails if you have limited time."
