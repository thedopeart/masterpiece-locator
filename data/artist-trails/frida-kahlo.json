  "introduction": "Frida Kahlo lived an extraordinary life marked by physical suffering, passionate love, and artistic genius. Born and died in the same house in Coyoacán, she transformed personal pain into universal art. Her self-portraits explored identity, gender, and Mexican heritage with unflinching honesty. Today, Casa Azul remains the essential pilgrimage for understanding this revolutionary artist.",
