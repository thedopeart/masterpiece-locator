  "introduction": "Salvador Dalí was equal parts genius and showman, creating some of the 20th century's most recognizable images while cultivating his eccentric persona. Born in Figueres, Catalonia, he conquered Paris with the Surrealists, scandalized and seduced New York, and returned to create a theatre-museum dedicated to his own legend. His trademark melting clocks, elephants on spider legs, and meticulous technique made dreams tangible.",
