  "introduction": "Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn was the greatest painter of the Dutch Golden Age. Born in Leiden, he conquered Amsterdam with his dramatic lighting and psychological depth. His self-portraits chart a lifetime of triumphs and tragedies: fame, fortune, bankruptcy, and the loss of his wife and children. Through it all, he painted with unflinching honesty, transforming himself and everyone around him into timeless art.",

      "description": "Rembrandt was born on July 15, 1606, the ninth child of a prosperous miller. Leiden was a thriving intellectual center, home to the oldest university in the Netherlands. Young Rembrandt enrolled at 14 but quickly abandoned academic studies for painting. He studied with local masters before opening his own studio, where he began exploring the dramatic chiaroscuro that would define his work.",
      "significance": "Leiden shaped Rembrandt's early style. His first self-portraits and history paintings emerged here. The intellectual atmosphere and Protestant culture influenced his lifelong engagement with biblical themes.",
