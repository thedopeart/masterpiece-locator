# Artwork Optimization Task

Read `CLAUDE.md` for guidelines, then check `ARTWORK-CHECKLIST.md` for TODO items.

**Pick 10-15 Tier 1 TODOs**, research each via Wikipedia/WebFetch, write descriptions and FAQs following the guidelines, update the database, then run `node get-artworks.js` to refresh the checklist.

Work systematically. Only write verified facts. Follow all formatting rules in CLAUDE.md.
