P.S.

  { slug: 'san-zaccaria', description: `<p>The <strong>Chiesa di San Zaccaria</strong> in Venice dates to the 9th century, though the current building combines Gothic and <a href="/apps/masterpieces/movement/renaissance"><strong>Renaissance</strong></a> styles from the 15th century. The church is famous for <a href="/apps/masterpieces/artist/giovanni-bellini"><strong>Giovanni Bellini's</strong></a> San Zaccaria Altarpiece (1505), considered one of the finest sacra conversazione paintings ever created.</p><p>Bellini painted it when he was in his seventies, achieving a luminous softness that influenced Venetian painting for generations.

  { slug: 'santa-felicita', description: `<p>The <strong>Church of Santa Felicita</strong> in Florence, just south of the Ponte Vecchio, contains one of the most startling works of Mannerist painting: Pontormo's <strong>Deposition from the Cross</strong> (1525-1528) in the Capponi Chapel. The painting's acid colors, weightless figures, and ambiguous spatial arrangement broke with High <a href="/apps/masterpieces/movement/renaissance"><strong>Renaissance</strong></a> conventions.</p><p>The Vasari Corridor runs above the church entrance, and the Medici grand dukes could watch Mass through a window without being seen by the congregation. The church itself is one of Florence's oldest, founded possibly as early as the 2nd century, though rebuilt multiple times. Pontormo's Annunciation, also in the Capponi Chapel, accompanies the Deposition.</p>` },

The fresco creates a dizzying vortex of ascending figures that seems to dissolve the dome into open sky.</p><p>This illusionistic technique, called "di sotto in sù" (seen from below), was ahead of its time and directly influenced <a href="/apps/masterpieces/movement/baroque"><strong>Baroque</strong></a> ceiling painting over a century later. The Romanesque cathedral also houses a relief of the Deposition by Benedetto Antelami (1178) in the right transept, one of the finest pieces of medieval Italian sculpture.</p>` },
