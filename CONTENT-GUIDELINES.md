# Masterpiece Locator Content Guidelines

## Artist Page Descriptions

Each artist page should have **one cohesive description** combining the artist bio with collection info.

### Structure

1. **First paragraph**: Artist bio (who they are, what they're known for)
2. **Second paragraph**: Collection info with internal links

### Requirements

- Use **1-2 bold keywords** within the description (e.g., artwork count, key terms)
- Include **internal links** to relevant pages:
  - Link movement names to `/movement/[slug]`
  - Link museum count to `/museums`
  - Link city names to `/city/[slug]` when relevant
- Keep it natural and conversational (avoid AI-sounding phrases)
- No separate "SEO intro" sections

### Example

> Claude Monet was a French painter and founder of Impressionism, best known for his water lily paintings and capturing light in outdoor scenes.
>
> We've catalogued **9 works** by Monet across [6 museums](/museums) worldwide, including key pieces from the [Impressionism](/movement/impressionism) movement. [Read more on Wikipedia →](https://wikipedia.org/...)

### Avoid

- Duplicate descriptions (one in header, another below)
- Generic phrases like "continues to draw art lovers from around the globe"
- "Below you'll find each painting..." (obvious/unnecessary)
- "making it easy to plan your museum visits" (salesy)

## Museum Page Descriptions

Similar approach: combine factual info with collection stats, use bold keywords and internal links.

## Artwork Page Descriptions

- Lead with the painting's significance or story
- Include artist link and museum link naturally
- Bold the **year created** and **current location**

## Internal Linking Strategy

Always link to:
- Artist names → `/artist/[slug]`
- Museum names → `/museum/[slug]`
- Movement names → `/movement/[slug]`
- City names → `/city/[slug]`

Use gold color (#C9A84C) for internal links to maintain brand consistency.
