    bioFull: `<p><a href="/movement/rococo"><strong>Rococo</strong></a> painter <strong>Giovanni Antonio Canal</strong>, known as Canaletto (1697-1768), became Venice's most celebrated view painter through his precisely rendered <strong>vedute</strong> of the city. Born to a theatrical scene painter, he learned perspective and stagecraft from his father before traveling to Rome in 1719, where Giovanni Paolo Pannini's topographical paintings inspired him to abandon theater for cityscapes. Returning to Venice, he developed a luminous style that captured the republic's canals, palaces, and ceremonies with almost photographic clarity.</p>

<p>Canaletto worked outdoors making pencil sketches, possibly aided by a <strong>camera obscura</strong>, then refined compositions in his studio. His paintings attracted British collectors on the Grand Tour, and the English merchant Joseph Smith became his agent, commissioning dozens of works eventually sold to George III. When the War of Austrian Succession reduced tourism, Canaletto moved to London in 1746, spending nearly a decade painting Thames views and English country houses. He returned to Venice in 1755, was elected to the Venetian Academy in 1763, and continued painting until his death. His nephew Bernardo Bellotto and pupil <a href="/artist/francesco-guardi"><strong>Francesco Guardi</strong></a> carried on the veduta tradition. Today the Royal Collection holds the world's largest group of his works. Major paintings also hang at the <a href="/museum/national-gallery"><strong>National Gallery</strong></a> London, the <a href="/museum/wallace-collection"><strong>Wallace Collection</strong></a>, and the <a href="/museum/met"><strong>Metropolitan Museum of Art</strong></a>.</p>`,

    bioFull: `<p><a href="/movement/rococo"><strong>Rococo</strong></a> painter <strong>Francesco Guardi</strong> (1712-1793) captured Venice with a poetic, atmospheric style that contrasted sharply with <a href="/artist/canaletto"><strong>Canaletto</strong></a>'s precision. Born into a family of painters, his father Domenico and brothers were all artists. His sister married Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. Francesco initially painted religious works alongside his brother Gian Antonio in the family workshop before focusing on <strong>vedute</strong> after his brother's death in 1760.</p>

<p>Guardi's approach transformed Venetian view painting. Where Canaletto rendered crisp architectural details, Guardi used <strong>spirited brushstrokes</strong> and dabs of color to suggest light dancing on water and buildings dissolving into lagoon mist. His technique, called <strong>pittura di tocco</strong> (painting by touch), emphasized mood over topographical accuracy. His skies brood, his palaces seem to shift, and his Venice appears more dreamlike than documentary. Commissions from the Venetian government in 1782 to celebrate visits by Russian Grand Dukes and Pope Pius VI brought official recognition and Academy membership. Yet Guardi died relatively poor in 1793, his loose style undervalued by contemporaries who preferred Canaletto's clarity. A century later, the <a href="/movement/impressionism"><strong>Impressionists</strong></a> rediscovered his work, recognizing him as a kindred spirit.

Born in Bolton-le-Moors, Lancashire, England, he emigrated with his family in 1818, settling eventually in Ohio. Largely self-taught, Cole moved to New York City in 1825 and hiked up the Hudson River to the Catskill Mountains. Three paintings from that trip, displayed in a bookshop window, caught the eye of Colonel John Trumbull, who purchased one and introduced Cole to the city's art establishment.</p>

<p>Cole's landscapes combined detailed observation with <strong>philosophical meditation</strong> on nature, time, and civilization. His five-painting series <strong>The Course of Empire</strong> (1833-36) traces a fictional civilization from wilderness through empire to desolation. <strong>The Voyage of Life</strong> (1842) follows a man from infancy to old age through allegorical river scenes. Beyond these moral allegories, Cole painted straightforward wilderness views that celebrated American nature as spiritual refuge from industrialization. <strong>The Oxbow</strong> (1836), showing Connecticut River valley farmland against untamed forest, became his most recognized single painting. Cole mentored <a href="/artist/albert-bierstadt"><strong>Frederic Edwin Church</strong></a>, who carried his vision forward. He died at 47 from pleurisy. Today the <a href="/museum/met"><strong>Metropolitan Museum of Art</strong></a> holds <strong>The Oxbow</strong>, and the New-York Historical Society displays <strong>The Course of Empire</strong>.

Born Hippolyte Delaroche in Paris, he trained under landscape painter Louis-Etienne Watelet before studying with history painter Antoine-Jean Gros. His approach blended the polished technique of <a href="/artist/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres"><strong>Neoclassicism</strong></a> with the emotional drama of <a href="/movement/romanticism"><strong>Romanticism</strong></a>, a middle ground the French called <strong>juste milieu</strong>.</p>

<p>Delaroche specialized in Tudor and Stuart history, which French audiences found exotic and compelling. <strong>The Children of Edward</strong> (1831), showing the doomed princes in the Tower of London, established his reputation. <strong>The Execution of Lady Jane Grey</strong> (1833) became one of the century's most popular paintings. It depicts the blindfolded teenage queen reaching for the execution block, her white dress radiant against the dark chamber. The theatrical staging and emotional intensity drew enormous crowds at the Paris Salon. Delaroche also painted French subjects, including <strong>Bonaparte Crossing the Alps</strong> (1850), which showed Napoleon on a mule rather than the heroic stallion of <a href="/artist/jacques-louis-david"><strong>David</strong></a>'s version. He held a professorship at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. <strong>Lady Jane Grey</strong>, thought destroyed in the 1928 Thames flood, was rediscovered rolled up in 1973 and restored.

Born on the outskirts of Naples, he trained with his brother-in-law Francesco Fracanzano and absorbed influences from Ribera's dramatic chiaroscuro. His father wanted him to become a lawyer or priest, but Rosa showed talent for painting, poetry, music, and acting. A romantic legend, likely apocryphal, claimed he lived among bandits in the Abruzzi mountains.</p>

<p>Rosa's landscapes feature <strong>jagged rocks, shattered trees, and wild storms</strong> populated by bandits, soldiers, and hermits. This was the opposite of Claude Lorrain's serene, golden Italian scenes. His bold temperament caused trouble: after publicly satirizing Bernini in Rome, he fled to Florence, spending nine years under Medici protection. He also painted battle scenes, philosophical subjects, and witchcraft themes that shocked contemporaries. As painter, poet, satirist, and actor, Rosa cultivated an image as a rebellious genius that made him a prototype for the Romantic artist. Edmund Burke cited him in his treatise on the <strong>sublime</strong>, and English landscape gardeners drew inspiration from his wild scenery. His reputation faded with the rise of Impressionism but has revived since the late 20th century.

After working as a clerk from age 12, he finally gained admission to the Royal Academy schools in 1844, where he met John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Together in 1848, they formed the <strong>Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood</strong>, rejecting academic conventions in favor of vivid color, minute detail, and serious subject matter.</p>

<p>Hunt alone remained faithful to Pre-Raphaelite principles throughout his career.

Born in Seville, the youngest of 14 children, he was orphaned by age 11 and raised by his older sister. He trained in the workshop of his uncle and godfather Juan del Castillo, absorbing a style characterized by <strong>soft expressions and loving sentiment</strong>. His 1645 marriage to Beatriz Cabrera produced 11 children, though at least four died in the devastating 1649 plague that killed half of Seville's population.</p>

<p>Murillo's religious paintings featured sweetly idealized Madonnas and saints that appealed to both clergy and lay audiences. His version of the <strong>Immaculate Conception</strong>, showing the Virgin on a crescent moon surrounded by cherubs, established an iconographic type followed for generations. His images of <strong>street children</strong> constitute a remarkable record of Seville's poor: <strong>The Young Beggar</strong> (c. 1645, now at the <a href="/museum/louvre"><strong>Louvre</strong></a>) shows a ragged boy picking fleas in a shaft of light. These works, often acquired by foreign collectors, reflected the bitter poverty ravaging 17th-century Seville.

Named for his birthplace near Parma, he trained locally before absorbing influences from Mantegna's precise draftsmanship and Leonardo's soft <strong>sfumato</strong>. Unlike the great artists of Rome and Florence, Correggio spent his career in provincial Parma, yet his innovations proved profoundly influential.</p>

<p>His ceiling frescoes transformed how artists depicted heavenly visions. The <strong>Camera di San Paolo</strong> (1519) in Parma's convent features an arbor with glimpses of playful cherubs through painted openings. The <strong>Vision of St. John on Patmos</strong> (1520-21) in San Giovanni Evangelista floats Christ in clouds above the worshipper. His masterpiece, the <strong>Assumption of the Virgin</strong> (c. 1526-30) in Parma Cathedral, creates the illusion of the dome opening to heaven, with swirling angels and saints in dramatic foreshortening. One contemporary dismissively called it a "ragout of frogs' legs," but the technique revolutionized ceiling decoration. His mythological paintings for the Duke of Mantua display equally sensuous handling. <strong>Jupiter and Io</strong> shows the god as an embracing cloud. Correggio married in 1519 and had a son, Pomponio, who became a painter of modest talent.

Born in Antwerp, he trained under his painter father, who was frequently in debt. The young Teniers had to copy old masters to support the family. In 1637, he married Anna Brueghel, daughter of <a href="/artist/jan-brueghel-elder"><strong>Jan Brueghel the Elder</strong></a> and granddaughter of the great <a href="/artist/pieter-bruegel-elder"><strong>Pieter Bruegel</strong></a>, linking him to Flanders' most celebrated artistic dynasty.</p>

<p>Teniers painted <strong>tavern scenes, village festivals, and peasant gatherings</strong> with warm humor and technical brilliance. His crowd scenes, often set in open landscapes, characterize figures with affection rather than mockery. Works from 1640-50 rank among his finest. He also painted alchemists in cluttered laboratories, guard room interiors, and religious subjects. In 1651, he became court painter and keeper of collections to Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in Brussels, an unprecedented honor for a painter. He documented the Archduke's picture gallery in detailed paintings and created 244 small copies of Italian works, published as engravings in <strong>Theatrum Pictorium</strong> (1660), an invaluable record of 17th-century collecting. He co-founded the Brussels Academy of Fine Arts in 1663. His compositions became so famous that peasant scenes were called "tenierkens" (little Teniers). About 2,000 paintings are attributed to him.

    bioFull: `<p><a href="/movement/baroque"><strong>Spanish Golden Age</strong></a> master <strong>Francisco de Zurbaran</strong> (1598-1664) earned the title "painter of monks" through austere, powerful religious works. Born in Fuente de Cantos, Extremadura, he left for Seville in 1614 to train with Pedro Diaz de Villanueva. There he formed a lifelong friendship with fellow student <a href="/artist/diego-velazquez"><strong>Diego Velazquez</strong></a>. His breakthrough came in 1626 with paintings for the Dominican convent of San Pablo el Real, and by 1628 the city elders invited him to relocate permanently to Seville.</p>

<p>Zurbaran's style combined <strong>dramatic chiaroscuro</strong> derived from <a href="/artist/caravaggio"><strong>Caravaggio</strong></a> with almost sculptural solidity. His monks and saints appear as three-dimensional presences, their white robes rendered with breathtaking virtuosity. He worked for ten different monastic orders, including Dominicans, Franciscans, and Carthusians. <strong>Saint Francis of Assisi</strong> was a favorite subject: nearly 50 paintings of the friar by Zurbaran or his workshop survive. King Philip IV summoned him to Madrid in 1634 to paint the <strong>Labours of Hercules</strong> and battle scenes for the Buen Retiro palace, reportedly calling him "painter to the king, king of painters." His still lifes, often depicting <a href="https://luxurywallart.com/collections/food-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>simple objects</strong></a> on dark backgrounds, anticipate modern painting's contemplative approach. After 1640, the softer style of <a href="/artist/bartolome-murillo"><strong>Murillo</strong></a> displaced his austere vision, and Zurbaran died in Madrid in poverty. His bold forms influenced <a href="/artist/edouard-manet"><strong>Manet</strong></a> and <a href="/artist/pablo-picasso"><strong>Picasso</strong></a>. Major works hang at the <a href="/museum/prado"><strong>Prado</strong></a>, the <a href="/museum/louvre"><strong>Louvre</strong></a>, and the <a href="/museum/met"><strong>Metropolitan Museum of Art</strong></a>.</p>`,
